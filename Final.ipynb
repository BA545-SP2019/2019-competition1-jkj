The numbers listed here are SIC codes which we looked up through SICCODE.com to fill in the blanks and manually type them in the speadsheet. Next, in the I3 column, we discovered a handful of NAICS codes which we translated to the SIC code equivalent. Lastly, for the values in the I3 column that had multiple SIC codes per row, we used SIC Code to determine the primary SIC Code and imputated those manually in Excel. \n",
